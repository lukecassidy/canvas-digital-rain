# canvas-digital-rain
Another HTML5 `<canvas>` project built in pure JavaScript. The goal here was to recreate the digital rain effect from The Matrix.

## Try It
Open `canvas.html` in your browser.

## How It Works
- Characters fall in vertical streams across the canvas, moving down one row at a time.
- Each char is randomly chosen from a mix of Latin letters, numbers and Japanese Katakana.
- A semi-transparent background fill creates the fading trail effect as chars descend.
- You might even spot a hidden message among the rain. True story.
